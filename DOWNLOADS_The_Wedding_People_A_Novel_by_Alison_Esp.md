Notes From Your Bookseller From the author of the acclaimed Notes on Your Sudden Disappearance comes a savvy blend of literary and beach read, taking a beach-and-wedding setting and dropping in layers of meaningful character development. With a big heart and a wry sense of humor, this is an honest story that will resonate with a wide audience. A propulsive and uncommonly wise novel about one unexpected wedding guest and the surprising people who help her start anew. Itâ€™s a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She&amp;#039;s immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but sheâ€™s actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isnâ€™t here for the big event. Phoebe is here because sheâ€™s dreamed of coming for yearsâ€”she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now sheâ€™s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe&amp;#039;s planâ€”which makes it that much more surprising when the two women canâ€™t stop confiding in each other. In turns absurdly funny and devastatingly tender, Alison Espachâ€™s The Wedding People is ultimately an incredibly nuanced and resonant look at the winding paths we can take to places we never imaginedâ€”and the chance encounters it sometimes takes to reroute us.
