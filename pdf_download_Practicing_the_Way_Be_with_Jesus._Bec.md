Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller This title pretty much says it all, but Practicing the Way is exactly that, a singular resource for being a disciple of Jesus. Packed with actionable steps to being more like Jesus, this book aims to get you closer to him. The author of the international bestseller The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry calls us to rediscover the path that leads to a deeper life with God.
  
 “One of the most important books I have read in a decade . . . If we would all follow in this way, our lives would change and the world would change.”—Jennie Allen, author of Get Out of Your Head and Find Your People
  
 We are constantly being formed by the world around us. To be formed by Jesus will require us to become his apprentice. 
 
 To live by what the first Christian disciples called a Rule of Life—a set of practices and relational rhythms that slow us down and open up space in our daily lives for God to do what only God can do—transforms the deepest parts of us to become like him. 
  
 This introduction to spiritual formation is full of John Mark Comer’s trademark mix of theological substance and cultural insight as well as practical wisdom on developing your own Rule of Life.
  
 These ancient practices have much to offer us. By learning to rearrange our days, we can follow the Way of Jesus. We can be with him. Become like him. And do as he did.
