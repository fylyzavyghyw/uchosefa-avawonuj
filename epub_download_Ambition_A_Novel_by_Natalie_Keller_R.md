The first book in Natalie Keller Reinert‚Äôs beloved Eventing Series, set in the high-stakes world of three-day eventing, now reimagined and repackaged!
 
 Jules Thornton didn‚Äôt come to Florida horse country to make friends. With her beloved horse Dynamo and her ruthless ambition, she is intent on becoming a world-class rider and trainer. Chasing dreams this big doesn‚Äôt leave much time for things like friends or vacations or properly cooked meals. And she certainly doesn‚Äôt have time for Pete Morrison, the handsome heir to one of Ocala‚Äôs grandest horse farms who keeps beating her at events and, for some reason, asking her out to dinner.
 
 But even Jules has to admit that she is hanging on by a thread. As a new horse challenges her skills and her farm slips toward bankruptcy, she begins to realize her ambition can only take her so far. With hurricane season on the horizon, Jules will need to learn to trust her community‚Äîor risk losing everything.
 
 In Natalie Keller Reinert‚Äôs beloved eight-book Eventing Series, we follow Jules and her friends through the joys and losses of competitive eventing, as they climb to the top of their sport‚Äîand into one another‚Äôs lives and hearts. Utterly immersive and propulsive, this series is an unforgettable journey for anyone who has ever fallen in love with horses, or humans.
