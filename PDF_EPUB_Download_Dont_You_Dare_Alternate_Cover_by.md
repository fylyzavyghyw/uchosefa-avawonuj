It was never meant to be more than a dare.

 A party game. A dare. A single kiss.

 That&amp;#039;s all it took to flip my world upside down.

 I&amp;#039;ve always classified myself as straight, and as far as I can tell, so has he.

 I didn&amp;#039;t think one kiss would change that, but I was so wrong.

 Now, I can&amp;#039;t stop thinking about him. In all the ways I shouldn&amp;#039;t.

 My best friend.

 Aspen.

 His taste is branded in my memory, his touch seared in my skin.

 And I want more.

 This simmering attraction I feel only grows with passing time.

 Which is why I start tossing out new dares.

 Riskier ones that toe lines we never thought we&amp;#039;d cross.

 I&amp;#039;m gambling with our friendship, knowing it could ruin us.

 But there&amp;#039;s so much more at stake here.

 Like my heart.


*Don&amp;#039;t You Dare is a new adult college romance featuring two best friends, too many baseball puns, scorching dirty talk, and a whole lot of bi-curious exploration. Not suitable for anyone under 18 years of age.*
