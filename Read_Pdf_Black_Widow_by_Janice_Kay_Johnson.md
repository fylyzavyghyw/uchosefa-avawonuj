Overview
A kiss good-night‚Ä¶
 
 Could be deadly
 
 Jordan Hendrick has had her guard up for as long as she can remember. It was hard enough surviving an abusive past with the ‚Äúhometown hero,‚Äù let alone the accusations and rumors that followed his death at her hands in self-defense. But someone wants revenge and Jordan is the number one suspect in a string of murders. Victims all connected to her‚Äîmen whose only crime was going out with Jordan. So trusting her new next-door neighbor, Tom Moore, is no easy endeavor. He‚Äôs handsome, a fierce defender and stand-in bodyguard when threats zero in on Jordan. The perfect catch‚Ä¶or the next casualty?
 
 From Harlequin Intrigue: Seek thrills. Solve crimes. Justice served.
